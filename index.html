        Jiraiya (自来也) was one of Konohagakure's Sannin. Famed as a hermit and
        pervert of stupendous ninja skill, Jiraiya travelled the world in search
        of knowledge that would help his friends, the various novels he wrote,
        and, posthumously, the world in its entirety – knowledge that would be
        passed on to his godson and final student, Naruto Uzumaki.
